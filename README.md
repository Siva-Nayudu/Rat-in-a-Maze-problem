# Rat-in-a-Maze-problem
Finding out the shortest path to the destination using matrix implemented using the Backtracking approach. Maze game is a well-known problem, where we are given a grid of 0’s and 1’s, 0’s corresponds to a place that can be traversed, and 1 corresponds to a place that cannot be traversed (i.e. a wall or barrier); the problem is to find a path from bottom left corner of grid to top right corner; immediate right, immediate left, immediate up and immediate down only are possible (no diagonal moves). We consider a variant of the maze problem where a cost (positive value) or profit (negative value) is attached to visiting each location in the maze, and the problem is to find a path of least cost through the maze. 

A backtracking algorithm tries to construct a solution to a computational problem incrementally, one small piece at a time. Whenever the algorithm needs to decide between multiple alternatives to the next component of the solution, it recursively evaluates every alternative and then chooses the best one. Backtracking is a systematic method to iterate through all the possible configurations of a search space. 

We chose backtracking method because we can stop anytime if we find moving forward is not possible/not useful. We first start with the source cell and move in a direction where the path is not blocked. If taken path makes us reach to the destination then the puzzle is solved else, we come back and change our direction of the path taken. We are going to implement the same logic in our code also.
